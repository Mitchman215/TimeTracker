# Installation

Note: Need to run npm install --legacy-peer-deps to install all the packages correctly.

Instructions for running:

Cd into the frontend folder, run npm install --legacy-peer-deps, and run npm start to start the project on localhost.
Once you navigate to http://localhost:3000/ after starting the project, you have to log in with a Brown email account via Google. Make sure your browser isn't synced to a non-Brown account, there is a bug with cookies that will not let you log in even after using a Brown account on such a browser.
Once you log in, feel free to explore the app!
